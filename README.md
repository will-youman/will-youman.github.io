Comp20 Assignment 1 

In general, this assignment has probably taken me a total of 5 or 6 hours. Truthfully, it should not have taken me that long. There was just a lot of instances in which I was making a really dumb mistake and could not figure it out. For example, I spent about a half hour trying to figure out why CSS file was not linking up with my HTML. In reality, the problem was there was an error in my HTML code which I should have had checked in the validator much sooner. Additionally, I was kind of hazy on some of the logistical details, especially with saving files and git up front. Also, I spent a ton of time trying to figure out why my links would not work and it is because I had misnamed my repository. All of these were silly mistakes but hopefully good lessons going forward.  

For this project I only really consulted the CSS and HTML cheat sheets provided, piazza, and various google resources on how to use git/github. 

Generally, my project is not as pretty as it could be. I hope to make it look better after because I want it to reflect well on me. However, the timing made me have to postpone that for now. Despite some of its aesthetic shortcomings, I believe I hit all of the major points from the rubric in terms of functionality.
